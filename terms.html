            The Spirit Jar, more commonly referred to as the "Urn" is an objective that spawns at 10 minutes, then every 5 minutes after that. 
            Players can pick up the urn when it spawns and take it across the map for bonus souls for their team, with the urn runner getting a few extra small bonuses. 
            The urn has a comeback mechanic, where if a team is behind by 15&percnt for the first urn and 10&percnt for every urn after that, the dropoff point will be favored for that team, regardless of who picks up the urn
