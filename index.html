                What is Deadlock?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Deadlock is a Free-To-Play Third person shooter <abbr>MOBA</abbr> (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) made by Valve. 
                It also has hero shooter elements, though it doesn't make much sense to compare it to games like Overwatch.
                Instead, Deadlock is much closer to games like Dota 2 in many ways, but with an entirely new perspective.
                This new perspective leads to completely new mechanics, including aiming and some of the best movement I have encountered.

            <h2>
                How do you play Deadlock?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Deadlock is still in a closed alpha state, meaning that you need an invite in order to play the game.
                Fortunately, there are tons of users out there who are willing to send invites to new players.
                You can ask in the Deadlock discord server or any Deadlock content creators servers for invites.
                Once you have an invite, you can play the game through Steam like you would any other game.

                What makes Deadlock special?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many thing smake Deadlock stand out from other games. 
                I think most people enjoy Deadlock for is the combination of complex systems from MOBAs and the mechanics of a shooter.
                Many people also enjoy the movement of the game and the many unique options that exist.
                Some people just like the characters, or playing the game with friends.
                Regardless, there's something for everyone in Deadlock, and it is up to you to find what it is that you enjoy about the game.
